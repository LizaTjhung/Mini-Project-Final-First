          <h4>Flordeliza V. Tjhung</h4>
          <p>
            A wife, a loving mom of two young boys, a daughter, a businesswoman,
            and a friend residing currently in Baguio City, Philippines. An
            observant woman who is an advocate of justice and integrity in a
            society in a manner that promotes equality for all. As a wife, she
            makes sure she supports his husband wherever he is. Being a mother is
            the toughest but most important and enjoyable thing for her. Hoping
            that with her guidance, she will be able to present her children who
            make a difference in the world. As a daughter, she wanted to return
            all the efforts her parents have done for her regardless of their
            shortcomings. Since she had not finished her degree, she chose to be
            engaged in business together with her husband as their source of
            income to support the family. And lastly, she is a friend who longs to
            relate and learn further about people’s feelings, needs, and wants,
            because she believes that as human beings, we interact to survive and
            be merry as one form of creation of God. No man is an island anyway.
            May you share with her hopes and dreams to have a better society
            composed of the smallest but the primary component of it, the family.
