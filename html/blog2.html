            the same time, afraid of what will happen during that day that our
            first baby will be out in this world. Others tend to ask as many
            people as they can about the dos and don’ts during the first years.
            Some will be reading as many blogs as possible or books about
            babies or watch YouTube channels regarding it.

            and other parents experiences on how they handled their first year
